/**
 * These lessons are created following kotlin tutorials
 * over TutorialsPoint https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kotlin/index.htm
 *
 * Kotlin = Java + Some Advanced Feature
 *        = OOPS + Functional Programming
 *        = More expressive than java. So easy readability
 *        = Depends internally on JVM Itself
 *        = Strongly statically typed language
 *        = programming language developed by Jet brains
 *        = Sometimes function declaration creates namespace problems.
 *        = Interoperable with java code as it creates exact same bytecode for jvm.
 *
 * Lets get started with our first hello world program.
 * Like java no need to define a class and a long public static void main method.
 * Just a method by the name main will do the trick.
 *
 *
 * Learn about basic function syntax in kotlin.
 *
 * Java Syntax = modifier returnType functionName(Arguments) { Body; }
 * Kotlin Syntax = modifier fun functionName(Arguments) : returnType { Body }
 *
 * Observe in the code below. We have used a kotlin predefined function println.
 * Instead of legendary static function of System class. System.out.println()
 */
fun main() {
    println("Hello World")
}
