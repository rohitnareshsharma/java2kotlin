 *
 * Kotlin = Java + Some Advanced Feature
 *        = OOPS + Functional Programming
 *        = More expressive than java. So easy readability
 *        = Depends internally on JVM Itself
 *        = Strongly statically typed language
 *        = programming language developed by Jet brains
 *
 * Lets get started with our first hello world program.
 * Like java no need to define a class and a long public static void main method.
 * Just a method by the name main will do the trick.
 *
 *
 * Learn about basic function syntax in kotlin.
 *
 * Java Syntax = modifier returnType functionName(Arguments) { Body; }
 * Kotlin Syntax = fun functionName(Arguments) : returnType { Body }
 *

fun main() {
    System.out.println("Hello World")
